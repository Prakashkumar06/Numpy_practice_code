# NumPy Practice Code

## Description
This repository contains my practice code for learning and mastering NumPy, a powerful library in Python for numerical computations. The code in this repository covers various aspects of NumPy, from basic operations to more advanced features.

## Contents
The repository is organized as follows:

- `basics/`: This directory contains scripts demonstrating the basic operations in NumPy such as array creation, indexing, slicing, and basic mathematical operations.
- `advanced/`: This directory contains scripts showcasing more advanced features of NumPy such as broadcasting, vectorized operations, and more complex mathematical functions.
- `applications/`: This directory contains scripts where I apply NumPy in practical scenarios, demonstrating its power and versatility.

## Installation
To run the scripts, you need to have Python and NumPy installed. You can install NumPy using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
